	Device lobby that contains the list of all registered devices.

	The href attribute of every reference node must contain the ABSOLUTE URI
	of relevant node, so that oBIX clients can get to know their real locations.

	Considering that it may contain hundreds of thousands lines of information
	the device lobby is declared as HIDDEN so as not to overwhelm the oBIX
	lobby object. Also this will help avoid displaying device lobby along with
	its reference node in the oBIX lobby already.
