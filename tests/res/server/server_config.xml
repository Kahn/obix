    <!--
      Defines minimum level of messages which will be printed. Available values:
      - debug: Write to log all possible messages;
      - warning: Write to log only warnings and errors;
      - error: Write to log only errors;
      - no: Do not write any log.

  	<level val="debug"/>
  	<!--
  	  Optional tag. If presents, forces to use syslog for logging. Otherwise all
  	  log messages are printed to console (stdout). This tag can have optional
  	  attribute 'facility' which specifies facility of syslog messages (read
  	  more about message facility in syslog documentation). 
  	  Possible values of the 'facility' attribute are:
  	  - user: Used for any user applications (default value);
  	  - daemon: Used for system daemons;
  	  - local0: System defined;
  	  - local1: System defined;
  	  - local2: System defined;
  	  - local3: System defined;
  	  - local4: System defined;
  	  - local5: System defined;
  	  - local6: System defined;
  	  - local7: System defined;
  	  It can be useful to configure syslog at your machine to print server log 
  	  into a separate file. One way to do so is:
  	  - Set in the tag below one of facilities local0 - local7 which is not 
  	    used in your system yet. For instance, you chose 'local1'
  	  - Go to syslog.conf file (usually it is at /etc/syslog.conf) and add the
  	    following string:
  	     local1.*		-/var/log/obix.log
  	    That will make syslog to write all messages sent from 'local1' to the
  	    file /var/log/obix.log. Symbol '-' before target path means that file
  	    will be written in asynchronous mode, which is quicker in general, but 
  	    new messages can appear with delay.  
  	  - It is also possible to forward error messages to a separate file like
  	    this:
  	     local1.err;local1.warning		-/var/log/obix-error.log
  	  You can read more about syslog configuration at syslog.conf manual page.
