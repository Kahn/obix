# Unit test: test_signup_exists.test 
#
# Downloads the oBIX base contract at /obix and tests for the presence of the
# oBIX signUp operation.  If this operation is removed or disabled, then the oBIX 
# server cannot accept new devices.
#
# Steps:
#
# 1) Download the oBIX base contract at /obix
# 2) Test for the presence of an err contract.  In this case, an error contract
#	 is desirable, and is an indication of the test passing.  All other responses
# 	 such as HTTP/500, or a valid oBIX response is a fail.
#
# At each step, output is validated.
