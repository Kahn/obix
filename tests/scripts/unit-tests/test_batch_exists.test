# Unit test: test_batch_exists.test
#
# Tests the oBIX base contract featured at /obix for the presence of the
# obix:Batch mechanism.
#
# Steps:
#
# 1) Download the oBIX base contract at /obix
# 2) Check for an 'op' node that has a name attribute called 'batch', and both 'in'
# 	 and 'out' parameters set to 'obix:BatchIn' and 'obix:BatchOut' respectively.
#
# At each step, output is validated.
