	Attempt to change sub nodes of the target node.

	For a deletion attempt, either the to-be-deleted node itself or its
	parent node must be writable so that the deletion can succeed.

	The attempt to change the val attribute also requires the target node
	itself is writable.

	Lastly, newly provided nodes are simply added to the target node,
	regardless of whether they are writable or not.
