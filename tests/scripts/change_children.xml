	Attempt to change sub nodes of the target node.

	For a deletion attempt, either the to-be-deleted node itself or its
	parent node must be writable so that the deletion can succeed.

	The attempt to change the val attribute also requires the target node
	itself is writable.

	However, newly provided nodes are simply added to the target node,
	regardless of whether the latter is writable or not.

	Lastly, now that the target node has been precisely specified by
	the request URI, the input root node may have an absolute href, or
	relative href, or even no href at all. However, its tag name must
	match with that of the target node.
