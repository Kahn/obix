	Attempt to add new subnodes to the target node.

	It's worthwhile to note that adding sub nodes to existing node does
	NOT require the target node to be writable, whereas changing its
	val attribute or deleting any of its sub nodes does require.

	However, the newly added nodes should better be writable so that
	they can be removed properly if needed.
