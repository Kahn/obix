	Attempt to add new subnodes to the target node.

	It's worthwhile to note that adding sub nodes to existing node does
	NOT require the target node to be writable, whereas changing its
	val attribute or deleting any of its sub nodes does require.

	However, the newly added nodes should better be writable so that
	they can be removed properly if needed.

	Lastly, now that the target node has been precisely specified by
	the request URI, the input root node may have an absolute href, or
	relative href, or even no href at all. However, its tag name must
	match with that of the target node.
