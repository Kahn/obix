<!--
	An example oBIX contract signed up at the oBIX server.

	The root node of the contract deliberately has the writable="true" setup
	so as to test that the signUp handler will always have it removed.

	Moreover, any writable attribute on any descendant won't be touched,
	therefore a device contract can have its subnodes added or deleted.

	However, since the device contract itself is not writable, once a direct
	subnode is removed, it cannot be re-installed.
